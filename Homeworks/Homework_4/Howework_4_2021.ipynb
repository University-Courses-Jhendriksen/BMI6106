We would like to know who is winning the race, and therefore we conduct a poll of likely voters in California. If the poll gives the voters a choice between the two candidates, then the results can be reasonably modeled with the Binomial Distribution. The polls indicate that 62% of the population intend to vote for Mr. Gubinator (Success).\n",
