    "It is said that de Mere had been betting that, in four rolls of a die, at least one six would turn up. He was winning consistently and, to get more people to play, he changed the game to bet that, in 24 rolls of two dice, a pair of sixes would turn up. It is claimed that de Mere lost with 24 and felt that 25 rolls were necessary to make the game favorable. "
